# My Home AR APP
Technology development has completely changed how consumers and the real estate sector engage. We introduce an augmented reality (AR) application designed to enhance the virtual real estate exploration experience for consumers, leveraging these enhancements. Key features include real-time monitoring of construction progress and virtual tours offering users a lifelike property exploration experience, providing comprehensive insights into space and design. This application, developed using marker-based technology, provides users with an interactive and dynamic way to access comprehensive property details in our AR application. In this paper, we present the testing results of our AR real estate application, where there are three aspects of testing carried out: viewpoint testing, functionality testing, and hardware testing. From the results obtained, we believe that the AR real estate application developed has achieved the standard of running the application well. We hope that for real estate developers, AR applications using marker-based technology can be used and implemented as part of their marketing efforts. Our application offers an innovative solution to meet the growing customer demand in the real estate industry, providing an interactive, informative, and immersive property selection experience.
